# Video & Audio

[AIMP](https://www.aimp.ru/?do=features) - Audio player. If you need something separate for separate audio playback.

[Audacity](https://github.com/audacity/audacity) - Best free audio editor. Great for beginners.

[MPC-HC](https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc) (Media Player Classic - Home Cinema) - Excellent video and audio player with many settings. A good alternative to [K-Lite Codec Pack](https://codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_full.htm).

[OBS Studio](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio) - Needs no introduction. A powerful screen recording and live streaming tool.

[Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) - A simple open source video editor. <br>
Perfect for those who don't want to spend money on Adobe products or are afraid of the high entry threshold in other tools. Stable releases can be found on the website or [server](https://download.kde.org/stable/kdenlive/).

[Codec Tweak Tool](https://www.codecguide.com/download_other.htm#codectweaktool) - The utility included in the [K-Lite Codec Pack](https://codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_full.htm) is now available as a separate tool. It is quite narrowly focused, but perhaps it will suit your needs for setting up codecs and filters.
