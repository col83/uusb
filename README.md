# uusb - ultimate usb

A place where I collect sets of utilities and software to store on the [Ventoy](github.com/ventoy/Ventoy) installation for many occasions.

All software is divided into groups. It is easy to guess what is responsible for what by the names of the group folders, so I will not describe each software list in detail here. Also, the groups have their own strict order described by a digital prefix. (at least, this is the order I see)

Each group folder will have its own README.md file for this purpose.

> For now, lists will be formed for Windows and Android. <p>

> Also, sometimes software can be duplicated in some categories. This is justified by the fact that in some category the use of one or another software may be clearly required, and in another category it may act as a lightweight version for specific jobs. For example, using [coreutils](github.com/uutils/coreutils) in Windows.

> May also contain scripts from my separate [repository](github.com/col83/scripts).

> Links are written without explicitly specifying the [security protocol](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) to avoid problems when launching pages in certain and/or old browsers. Also, with certain network settings, problems with [TLS](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) may occur. (except in cases where the "[www](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)" prefix is still required)
